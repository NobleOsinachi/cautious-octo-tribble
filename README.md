# Worded Next Js 

This repository is a clone of [worded.netlify.app](https://worded.netlify.app) implemented using Next.js. It serves as a learning project for JavaScript and Next.js, and aims to replicate the functionalities of the original website.

# Project Background
The project was initially started in 2020 as a final project of the Learn Javascript Online training organised for UNILAG students during the lockdown period. Now, with the knowledge gained from learning Next.js, I intend to reimplement the same project using the Next JS framework in Typescript.
